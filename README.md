# observational-causal-inference-simulation
simulating different (observational) causal inference concepts

The intention is mostly for self-learning - these are some of the methods that I've studied for work-related projects because a lot of people agree that simulating data and playing with the results yourself is an important complement to reading the available literature, and I think this is especially important for observational causal inference projects due to its delicate nature. Posting it publicly of-course helps induce a heightened feeling of accountability (perhaps artificial) as well as inviting feedback, another great way to learn. 

So far the topics covered are:
- Matching methods
- Sensitivity Analysis (for cross-sectional data)
- Panel methods
- DAGs
- Exploring a claimed diagnostic method called "Backwards Causality" and A/A Testing
- Taking notes on the `DoWhy` Python package
