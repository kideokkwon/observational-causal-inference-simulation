# observational-causal-inference-simulation
simulating different (observational) causal inference concepts

The order of publish for these notebooks demonstrate the coincidental path that I took in my causal inference journey (although not all steps are mentioned).

So far the topics covered are:
- Matching / Weighting methods (e.g., Coarsened Exact Matching, Entropy Balancing, Propensity Score Weighting)
- Sensitivity Analysis (for cross-sectional data)
- Panel methods
- DAGs
- Exploring a claimed diagnostic method called "Backwards Causality" and A/A Testing
- Taking notes on the `DoWhy` Python package
- Instrumental Variables
- Double / Debiased Machine Learning

If I were to go back in time, I would probably want to start differently and save a lot of time. Notably, I would want to focus a lot of my efforts on Double / Debiased ML.
